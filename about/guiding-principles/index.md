# Guiding Principles



<div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Easy to adopt - easy to contribute</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
  <p>From the prescriptive nature of the CycloneDX object model, to the standardization process, the objective is to provide an easy path for adopting CycloneDX. Including community contributions or implementations, or participating in the evolution of the standard.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Open source standard - permissive, commercial friendly, license</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
  <p>CycloneDX and official extensions are available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license. There are no opinionated license defaults or limitations for how CycloneDX SBOMs can be shared with others.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Identify risk to as many adopters as possible, as quickly as possible</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
  <p>The CycloneDX project takes a risk-based approach to standards development. As a result, standard revisions are efficiently delivered to market allowing adopters to quickly benefit from improvements.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Avoid any/all blockers that prevent the identification of risk</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
  <p>The CycloneDX project avoids obstacles that would delay the release of standards or extensions to adopters, without affecting quality.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Continuous improvement - innovate quickly, improve over time</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
  <p>Incremental and measurable improvement is a foundational principle of the CycloneDX project. Rather than spending years attempting to draft the perfect standard, the project focuses on core use cases and expands capabilities over time.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Encourage innovation and competition through extensions</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
  <p>Innovation and experimentation is encouraged through the use of extensions to the CycloneDX standard. This allows for rapid prototyping, testing, and verification, without impacting the core standard.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Produce immutable and backward compatible releases</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
  <p>All CycloneDX releases are production quality standards that do not change. When drafting revisions, backwards compatibility with prior versions is of upmost priority.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Facts first - dynamic facts and observations enabled through extensions</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
  <p>CycloneDX takes a facts-first approach to the core standard. Static facts, or other pieces of information that do not change over time, are accounted for in the core specification. Extensions support opinions and dynamic facts which are subject to change.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Automation and optimization of BOM creation</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
  <p>The CycloneDX project focuses on the efficiency at which BOMs are created. By creating implementations that are easily automatable and integrated into all major development platforms and ecosystems.</p>
</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Full-stack BOM specification</button>
<div class="collapsible-content">
  <p>CycloneDX describes the entire stack for which software runs. Including operating systems, containers, firmware, applications, libraries, frameworks, files, services, and optionally, hardware.</p>
</div>
