<img src="/theme/assets/images/high-level-object-model-small.svg" width="331" height="202" alt="CycloneDX Object Model Overview" style="display:block; float:right; margin:10px">

The CycloneDX object model:
* can be represented as XML, JSON and Protocol Buffers
* consists of [metadata](#bom-metadata), [components](#components), [services](#services), and [dependencies](#dependencies)
* is prescriptive and simple to use
* can easily describe complex relationships
* is [extensible](#extensions) to support specialized and future use cases


## BOM Metadata
BOM metadata includes the supplier, manufacturer, and the target component for which the BOM describes. It also includes
the tools used to create the BOM, and license information for the BOM document itself.

## Components
Components describe the complete inventory of first-party and third-party components. Component identity can be represented as:
* Coordinates (group, name, version)
* [Package URL](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec)
* [Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe)
* [SWID (ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015)](https://www.iso.org/standard/65666.html)
* Cryptographic hash functions (SHA-1, SHA-2, SHA-3, BLAKE2b, BLAKE3)

CycloneDX can represent applications, frameworks, libraries, containers, operating systems, devices, firmware, files, along
with the manufacturer information, license and copyright details, and complete pedigree and provenance for every component.

## Services
Services describe external APIs that the software may call. Services describe endpoint URIâ€™s, authentication requirements, 
and trust boundary traversals. The flow of data between software and services can also be described including the data 
classifications, and the flow direction of each type.

## Dependencies
CycloneDX provides the ability to describe components and their dependency on other components. The dependency graph is 
capable of representing both direct and transitive relationships. Components that depend on services can be represented 
in the dependency graph and services that depend on other services can be represented as well.

## Compositions
Compositions describe constituent parts (including components, services, and dependency relationships) and their 
completeness. The aggregate of each composition can be described as complete, incomplete, incomplete first-party only, 
incomplete third-party only, or unknown.

## Extensions
Multiple extension points exist throughout the CycloneDX object model allowing fast prototyping of new capabilities
and support for specialized and future use cases. The CycloneDX project maintains extensions that are beneficial to
the larger community. The project encourages community participation and development of extensions that target 
specialized or industry-specific use cases.


## Registered Media Types

The following media types are officially registered with IANA:

| Media Type | Format | Assignment |
| ------- | --------- | --------- |
| application/vnd.cyclonedx+xml | XML | [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.cyclonedx+xml) |
| application/vnd.cyclonedx+json | JSON | [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.cyclonedx+json) |

Specific versions of CycloneDX can be specified by using the version parameter. i.e. `application/vnd.cyclonedx+xml; version=1.3`.

The officially supported media type for Protocol Buffer format is `application/x.vnd.cyclonedx+protobuf`.
