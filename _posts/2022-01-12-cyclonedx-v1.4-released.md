subtitle: Adds enhanced support for known unknowns, copyright and license evidence, protocol buffers, and extensibility improvements
excerpt: Continuing our risk-based approach to standards development, CycloneDX v1.4 includes several backward-compatible improvements including Compositions which describe the completeness of inventory and relationships, support for describing evidence of copyright statements and additional licenses, support for Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for highly efficient machine-to-machine transport, and support for Properties which is a name/value store allowing easy extensibility of the spec.
