## Introduction

Modern software is assembled using third-party and open source components. Glued together in complex and unique ways 
and integrated with original code to achieve the desired functionality. An accurate inventory of all components enables 
organizations to identify risk, allows for greater transparency, and enables rapid impact analysis.

CycloneDX was created for this purpose.

Strategic direction and maintenance of the specification is managed by the CycloneDX Core working group, with origins
in the [OWASP](https://owasp.org) community.

## Project Goals
- Define a vendor agnostic specification independent of language or ecosystem
- Specification should be machine readable
- Specification should be easy to implement with minimal effort
- Specification should be simple and performant to parse
- Specification should provide lightweight schema definitions for JSON and XML
- Specification should reuse parts of existing specs where beneficial
- Specification should be extensible to support specialized and future use cases
- Specification should be decentralized, authoritative, and security focused
- Specification should promote continuous component analysis
- Specification should support hardware, libraries, frameworks, applications, containers, and operating systems
